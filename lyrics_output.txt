"You"
You are the sun and moon and stars, are you
And I could never run away from you

You try at working out chaotic things
And why should I believe myself, not you?

It's like the world is going to end so soon
And why should I believe myself?

You, me and everything caught in the fire
I can see me drowning, caught in the fire

The earlier version finishes with the following:
Hey the sun and moon and stars are yeah..
But I won't share myself with you
You to me

"Creep"
When you were here before,
Couldn't look you in the eye,
You're just like an angel,
Your skin makes me cry,
You float like a feather,
In a beautiful world,
I wish I was special,
<i>[Album version:]</i> You're so fucking special.
<i>[Clean version:]</i> You're so very special.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo,
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here.

I don't care if it hurts,
I want to have control,
I want a perfect body,

I want a perfect soul,
I want you to notice,
When I'm not around,
<i>[Album version:]</i> You're so fucking special,
<i>[Clean version:]</i> You're so very special,
I wish I was special.

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo,

She run run run run...
Run...

Whatever makes you happy,
Whatever you want,

I wish I was special...
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo,
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here,
I don't belong here.


"How Do You?"
He's bitter and twisted
He knows what he wants
He wants to be loved and he wants to belong
He wants us to listen, he wants us to weep
And he was a stupid baby who turned into a powerful freak

But how do you?
How do you?
How do you?

He lives with his mother
But we show him respect
He's a dangerous bigot, but we always forget
And he's just like his daddy because he cheats on his friends
And he steals and he bullies anyway that he can

But how do you?
How do you?
How do you?


"Stop Whispering"
And the wise man say I don't want to hear your voice
And the thin man say I don't want to hear your voice
And they're cursing me, and they won't let me be
And there's nothing to say, and there's nothing to do

Stop whispering, start shouting
Stop whispering, start shouting

And the mother say we spit on your son some more
And the buildings say we spit on your face some more
And the feeling is that there's something wrong
Because I can't find the words and I can't find the songs

Stop whispering, start shouting
Stop whispering, start shouting

Dear Sir, I have a complaint
Can't remember what it is

It doesn't matter anyway
It doesn't matter anyway


"Thinking About You"
Been thinking about you, your record's a hit
Your eyes are on my wall, your teeth are over there
But I'm still no-one, and you're not a star
What do you care?

Been thinking about you, and there's no rest
Shit, I still love you, still see you in bed
But I'm playing with myself, and what do you care
When the other men are far, far better

All the things you got
All the things you need
Who bought you cigarettes and bribed the company
To come and see you, honey

I've been thinking about you, so how can you sleep
These people aren't your friends, they're paid to kiss your feet
But they don't know what I know, and why should you care
When I'm not there

Been thinking about you, and there's no rest
Shit, I still love you, still see you in bed
But I'm playing with myself, what do you care
When I'm not there

All the things you got, you'll never need
All the things you've got, I bled and I bleed to please you

Been thinking about you...

Destiny, destiny protect me from the world
Destiny, hold my hand protect me from the world

"Vegetable"
I never wanted anything but this
I tried hard, worked hard
I ran around in domestic bliss
I fought hard, died hard

Everytime you're running over me
Everytime you're running I can see

I'm not a vegetable
I will not control myself
I spit on the hand that feeds me
I will not control myself

I never wanted any broken bones
Scarred face, no home
Your words surround me and I asphyxiate
And I burn all hate

Everytime you're running out on me
Everytime you're running I can see

I'm not a vegetable
I will not control myself
I spit on the hand that feeds me

I spit on the hand that feeds me
I will not control myself..


"Prove Yourself"
I can't afford to breathe in this time
Nowhere to sit without a gun in my hand
Hooked back up to the cathode ray
I'm better off dead
I'm better off dead

Prove yourself
Prove yourself
Prove yourself

I wanna breathe, I wanna grow

Prove yourself

Prove yourself

Why?


"I Can't"
Please forget the words that I just blurted out
It wasn't me, it was my strange and creeping doubt
It keeps rattling my cage
And there's nothing in this world will keep it down

Even though I might, even thought I try, I can't
Even though I might, even thought I try, I can't

So many things that keep,  that keep me underground
So many words that I, that I can never find
If you give up on me now I'll be gutted like I've never been before

And even though I might, even thought I try, I can't
Even though I might, even thought I try, I can't

If you give up on me now I'll be gutted like I've never been before

"Blow Out"
In my mind
And nailed into my heels
All the time
Killing what I feel

And everything I touch

(all wrapped up in sugar-coated pills)
Turns to stone
Everything I touch
(all wrapped up in cotton wool)

Turns to stone

I am fused
Just in case I blow out

Just in case I crack out

Faith, you're driving me away
You do it everyday
You don't mean it

My brain says I'm receiving pain
A lack of oxygen
From my life support
My iron lung

We're too young to fall asleep

Bummed out again by your only business friend
The smell of fear is thicker than you think

"Punchdrunk Lovesick Singalong"
I wrapped you inside my coat 
When they came to firebomb the house 
I didn't feel pain, 'cause no-one can touch me 
Now that I'm held in your spell 

A beautiful girl 
A beautiful girl 
Can turn your world into dust 

Sell me a car that goes 
Sell me a house that stands

It must be hard
With your head on backwards


"Lozenge Of Love"
I am gone
Everybody's raging
And these fruits
They still taste of poison
I won't be around

I need warmth
A restless body cracks some more
I won't have the strength
When you really need me


"You Never Wash Up After Yourself"
I must get out once in a while
Everything is starting to die
The dust settles
The worms dig
Spiders crawl over the bed

I must get out once in a while
I eat all day and now I'm fat
Yesterday's meal is hugging the plates
You never wash up after yourself

"Planet Telex"
You can force it but it will not come
You can taste it but it will not form
You can crush it but it's always here
You can crush it but it's always near
Chasing you home saying
Everything is broken
Everyone is broken

You can force it but it will stay stung
You can crush it as dry as a bone

"The Bends"
Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now, when I need you
Alone on an aeroplane
Fall asleep on against the window pane
My blood will thicken

I need to wash myself again to hide all the dirt and pain
'Cause I'd be scared that there's nothing underneath
But who are my real friends?
Have they all got the bends?
Am I really sinking this low?

My baby's got the bends, oh no
We don't have any real friends, no, no, no

Just lying in the bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the sixties, I wish I could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen

Where do we go from here?
The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
And where are you?
They brought in the CIA, the tanks and the whole marines
To blow me away, to blow me sky high

My baby's got the bends
We don't have any real friends

Just lying in the bar with my drip feed on

"High &amp; Dry"
Two jumps in a week
I bet you think that's pretty clever don't you boy?
Flying on your motorcycle,
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
You'd kill yourself for recognition,
Kill yourself to never ever stop
You broke another mirror,
You're turning into something you are not

Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry

Drying up in conversation,
You will be the one who cannot talk
All your insides fall to pieces,
You just sit there wishing you could still make love
They're the ones who'll hate you
When you think you've got the world all sussed out
They're the ones who'll spit at you,
You will be the one screaming out

Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry

It's the best thing that you ever had,
The best thing that you ever, ever had
It's the best thing that you ever had,
The best thing you ever had has gone away

Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry


"Fake Plastic Trees"
Her green plastic watering can
For her fake Chinese rubber plant
In the fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plans
To get rid of itself

It wears her out, it wears her out
It wears her out, it wears her out

She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins

It wears him out, it wears him out
It wears him out, it wears him out

She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love
But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run

It wears me out, it wears me out
It wears me out, it wears me out

If I could be who you wanted
If I could be who you wanted all the time

All the time...
All the time...


"Bones"
I don't want to be crippled cracked
Shoulders, wrists, knees and back
Ground to dust and ash
Crawling on all fours

When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones

Now I can't climb the stairs
Pieces missing everywhere
Prozak painkillers

When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones
And I used to fly like peter pan
All the children flew when I touched their hands

When you've got to feel it in your bones
When you've got to feel it in your bones


"(Nice Dream)"
They love me like I was a brother
They protect me, listen to me
They dug me my very own garden
Gave me sunshine, made me happy

Nice dream, nice dream, nice dream

I call up my friend, the good angel
But she's out with her ansaphone
She says she would love to come help but
The sea would electrocute us all

Nice dream <i>[x7]</i>

If you think that you're strong enough
If you think you belong enough
If you think that you're strong enough
If you think you belong enough

Nice dream <i>[x4]</i>


"Just"
Can't get the stink off
He's been hanging round for days
Comes like a comet
Suckered you but not your friends
One day he'll get to you
And teach you how to be a holy cow

You do it to yourself, you do
And that's what really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself
Just you and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself

Don't get my sympathy
Hanging out the 15th floor
You've changed the locks three times
He still comes reeling through the door
One day I'll get you
And teach you how to get to purest hell

You do it to yourself, you do
And that's what really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself
Just you, you and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself

You do it to yourself, you do
And that's what really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself
Just you, you and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself.. yourself.. yourself..

Limb by limb and tooth by tooth
Tearing up inside of me
Every day every hour
I wish that I was bullet proof

Wax me
Mould me
Heat the pins and stab them in
You have turned me into this

Leadfill the hole in me
I could burst a million bubbles
All surrogate and bullet proof

I get home from work and you're still standing in your dressing gown
Well what am I to do?
I know all the things around your head and what they do to you
What are we coming to?
What are we gonna do?

Blame it on the black star

The troubled words of a troubled mind I try to understand what is eating you

"Sulk"
You bite through the big wall, the big wall bites back
You just sit there and sulk, sit there and bawl
You are so pretty when you're on your knees
Disinfected, eager to please

Sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes and we've already gone
Just like your dad, you'll never change

Each time it comes it eats me alive
I try to behave but it eats me alive
So I declare a holiday
Fall asleep, drift away

"Street Spirit (Fade Out)"
Rows of houses, all bearing down on me
I can feel their blue hands touching me
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
And fade out again and fade out

This machine will, will not communicate
These thoughts and the strain I am under
Be a world child, form a circle
Before we all go under
And fade out again and fade out again

Cracked eggs, dead birds
Scream as they fight for life
I can feel death, can see its beady eyes
All these things into position
All these things we'll one day swallow whole
And fade out again and fade out again

Immerse your soul in love
IMMERSE YOUR SOUL IN LOVE

In a jackknifed juggernaut 
I am born again 

In the neon sign
Scrolling up and down
I am born again

In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe

In a deep deep sleep of the innocent
I am born again

In a fast german car
I'm amazed that I survived
An airbag saved my life

"Paranoid Android"
Please could you stop the noise, I'm trying to get some rest
From all the unborn chicken voices in my head
What's that...? (I may be paranoid, but not an android)
What's that...? (I may be paranoid, but not an android)

When I am king, you will be first against the wall
With your opinion which is of no consequence at all
What's that...? (I may be paranoid, but no android)
What's that...? (I may be paranoid, but no android)

Ambition makes you look pretty ugly
Kicking and squealing gucci little piggy

Off with his head, man
Off with his head, man
Why don't you remember my name?
I guess he does....

"Subterranean Homesick Alien"
The breath of the morning
I keep forgetting
The smell of the warm summer air

I live in a town
Where you can't smell a thing
You watch your feet
For cracks in the pavement

Up above
Aliens hover
Making home movies
For the folks back home

Of all these weird creatures
Who lock up their spirits
Drill holes in themselves
And live for their secrets

They're all uptight
Uptight.. <i>[x7]</i>

I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
Late at night when I'm driving
Take me on board their beautiful ship
Show me the world as I'd love to see it

I'd tell all my friends
But they'd never believe
They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely

I'd show them the stars
And the meaning of life
They'd shut me away
But I'd be all right
All right..

I'm just uptight
Uptight.. <i>[x7]</i>


"Exit Music (For A Film)"
Wake.. from your sleep
The drying of your tears
Today we escape, we escape

Pack.. and get dressed
Before your father hears us
Before all hell breaks loose

Breathe, keep breathing
Don't lose your nerve
Breathe, keep breathing
I can't do this alone

Sing.. us a song
A song to keep us warm
There's such a chill, such a chill

You can laugh
A spineless laugh
We hope your rules and wisdom choke you
Now we are one in everlasting peace

We hope that you choke, that you choke
We hope that you choke, that you choke
We hope that you choke, that you choke


"Let Down"
Transport, motorways and tramlines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings
Disappointed people clinging on to bottles
And when it comes it's so so disappointing

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Don't get sentimental
It always ends up drivel

One day I'm going to grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and ...

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

Let down again
Let down again
Let down again

You know, you know where you are with
You know where you are with
Floor collapsing
Floating, bouncing back
And one day....
I am going to grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and...

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around


"Karma Police"
Karma police, arrest this man
He talks in maths
He buzzes like a fridge
He's like a detuned radio

Her Hitler hairdo is
Making me feel ill
And we have crashed her party

This is what you get
This is what you get
This is what you get when you mess with us

Karma police
I've given all I can
It's not enough
I've given all I can
But we're still on the payroll

This is what you get
This is what you get
This is what you get when you mess with us

For a minute there, I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there, I lost myself, I lost myself

For a minute there, I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there, I lost myself, I lost myself

A heart that's full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you

A handshake of carbon monoxide

I want to thank you, thank you, thank you all
I'm having such a good time, a good time, had enough?

I'm taking you down
I'm taking you down
I'm taking you down when I go down
I'm taking you down
I'm taking you down
I'm standing in the hall
Kicking out the wall
Bit me, bit me, bit me, oh
Bit me, bit me, bit me, oh
I've got the poison


"4 Minute Warning"
This is just a nightmare
But soon I'm going to wake up
Someone's gonna bring me around

Running from the bombers
Hiding in the forest
Running through the fields

Laying flat on the ground
Just like everybody
Stepping over heads

Running through the underground
And this is your warning
4 minute warning

I don't wanna hear it
I don't wanna grow old
I just wanna run and hide

Now I'm in a nightmare
But soon I'm gonna wake up
Someone's gonna bring me 'round

This is your warning
4 minute warning


"Bloom"
Open your mouth wide
The universal sigh
And while the ocean blooms
It's what keeps me alive
So why does it still hurt?
Don't blow your mind with why

I'm moving out of orbit
Turning in somersaults
I dive into those eyes
Jellyfish swim by


"Morning Mr Magpie"
You got some nerve, coming here
You got some nerve, coming here
You stole it all, give it back
You stole it all, give it back

Good Morning, Mr. Magpie
How are we today?
And now you stole it, all the magic
took my memories

(Ooohhhh)
(No no no no no no)

You know you should, but you don't
You know you should, but you don't

Good Morning, Mr. Magpie
How are we today?
And now you stole it, all the magic
took my melody


"Little By Little"
Turn to nasty now
The dark cell
The pit of my soul
The last one out of the box
The one who broke this spell

Little by little by hook or by crook
I'm such a tease
And you're such a flirt
Once you've been hurt
You've been around enough

Little by little by hook or by crook
Never get nervous
Never get judged
I'm no idiot
I should look

Your clue on hold, snapped up
Crawling with my love
The last one out of the box
The one that broke the seal
Obligation
Complication
Routines and schedules
Drug and kill you
Kill you

Little by little by hook or by crook
Never get nervous
Never get judged
I'm no idiot
I should look


"Lotus Flower"
I will shape myself into your pocket
Invisible, do what you want, do what you want
I will shrink and I will disappear
I will slip into the groove and cut me up, and cut me up

There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
And now I'll set you free
I'll set you free
There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
Tonight I'll set you free
I'll set you free

Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
I can't kick your habit
Just to feed your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart

We will shrink and be quiet as mice
While the cat is away; do what we want
Do what we want

There's an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I set you free
I set you free

'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is

Put the lotus flower into my room

Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
'Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
I dance around a pit
The darkness is beneath
I can't kick your habit
Just to feed your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart


"Codex"
Sleight of hand
Jump off the end
Into a clear lake
No one around

Just dragonflies
Fantasize
No one gets hurt
You’ve done nothing wrong

Slide your hand
Jump off the end
The water's clear and innocent
The water's clear and innocent


"Give Up The Ghost"
Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me
Don't hurt me

Gather up the lost and sold (Don't hurt me)

In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)

Gather up the pitiful (Don't hurt me)

In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)

What seems impossible (Don't hurt me)

In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)

I think I have had my fill (Don't hurt me)

In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)

I think I should give up the ghost (Don't hurt me)

In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)
In your arms (Don't hurt me)


"Separator"
It's like I'm falling out of bed
From a long, weary dream
The sweetest flowers and fruits hang from the trees
Falling off the giant bird that’s been carrying me
It's like I'm falling out of bed from a long and weary dream

Just exactly as I remember
Every word
Every gesture
I'm a heart in cold ground

Like I'm falling out of bed
From a long and weary dream
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying

Every woman blows her cover
In the eye of the beholder
I'm a fish now out of water

Falling off a giant bird that's been carrying me

I fell open
I laid under
At the tip out
I was just a number

I wanna slip it over
And get back under
And if you think this is over
Then you're wrong
If you think this is over
Then you're wrong

(Wake me up, wake me up)

If you think this is over
Then you're wrong
If you think this is over
Then you're wrong

(Wake me up, wake me up)

Like I'm falling out of bed from a long and weary dream
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying

When I ask you again
When I ask you again
Wake me up, wake me up


"Banana Co."
Oh Banana co.
We really love you and we need you
And oh banana co.
We'd really love to believe you

But everything's underground
We gotta dig it up somehow
Yeah yeah

Oh she said &quot;No go&quot;
She said she'd like to
She's seen you
But no, banana co.
She knows if you die then we all do

And everything's underground
We've gotta dig it up somehow
Yeah yeah
Everything's burning down
We gotta put it out somehow
Yeah yeah


"Bishop's Robes"
Dressed in Bishop's robes
Terrifies me still
In bishop's robes
Bastard headmaster

I'm not going back
I'm not going back
I'm not going back

Children taught to kill
To tear themselves to bits
On playing fields
Dressed in bishop's robes

I'm not going back
I'm not going back
I'm not going back


"Coke Babies"
Easy living, easy hold
Easy teething, easy fold
Easy listening, easy love
Easy answers to easy questions
Easy tumble, easy doll
Easy rumble, easy fall
I get up on easy love
I get up on easy questions


"Cut A Hole"
Wish that I could come out of your phone
Superhero powers
Burst out of the sound
And I bought you flowers
You just say the word
I could wish she comes
With a long and winning handsome smile
Wish we could connect
Step into the void
Off the diving board
Blend into the light
Down the cable lines
Roll onto the earth
Reforming on the wind
Two places at once
Taste the air with you
Undo all the ties
Wish that I could flick on all those lights
Lift this all away
See that stretchy smile go
Right across your face

Cut a hole
Cut a hole
Cut a hole.


"Cuttooth"
I will leave the wall paper life,
and run away to the foreign legion...
I will leave the wall paper life,
and run away to the foreign legion...

And as the tanks roll into town..
As the tanks roll into town..

A little bit of knowledge will destroy you..
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you.. 

And as the tanks roll into town..
As the tanks roll into town..

A little bit of knowledge will destroy you..
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you..

I don't know why I feel so tongue-tied;
I don't know why I feel so skinned alive.

Run until your lungs are sore, 
until you cannot feel it anymore.
Run until your lungs are sore, 
until you find an open door.

I'll build you up to pull you down.
Tie you to your feet and watch you drown.
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you...
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
I'll build you up to pull you down.
Tie you to the stake and watch you burn in Hell,
In Hell...
I don't know why I feel so tongue-tied
I don't know why I feel so skinned alive

I'll find another skin to wear.
I'll find another skin to wear.


"Faithless The Wonder Boy"
I've had these jeans since I was born
And now they're ripped and now they're torn
And all my friends have skateboards

I want the toys of other boys
I want a knife and a gun and things
But Mum and Dad will not give in

And I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
No I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in

And now I know just what it is
It's got disease and it's got my head
It always runs where I hide

Too scared to talk, too scared to try
Too scared to know the reasons why
And all my friends say bye bye

And I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
No I can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in
Can't put the needle in...


"Fog"
There's a little child
Running round this house
And he never leaves
He will never leave
And the fog comes up from the sewers
And glows in the dark

Baby alligators in the sewers grow up fast
Grow up fast
Anything you want it can be done
How did you go bad?
Did you go bad?
Did you go bad?
Some things will never wash away
Did you go bad?
Did you go bad?
